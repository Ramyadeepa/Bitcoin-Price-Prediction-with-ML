# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-with-ML

OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT
Using historical data and machine learning techniques, Bitcoin price prediction aims to forecast future price movements. Models analyze factors such as trading volume, sentiment, and economic indicators. These predictions assist investors, traders, and businesses in decision-making. However, caution is needed due to market volatility and external influences. Machine learning provides valuable insights but should be used alongside other tools for analysis and decision-making.
